# School_District_Analysis
## Analysis
### Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this school district analysis was to provide Maria, the school district superintendent, an analysis of grades coming from the 15 high schools in her district. Two files were analyzed. One contains each of the schools and its type, budget and size. The other contains information about the students attending the schools, including their grade, gender, and reading and math scores. By merging the files and running the analysis, Maria wants to be able to determine which schools are performing the best and the worst and then see if there is any correlation between size, budget, etc. While doing the analysis, it was also discovered that one high school may have been a little dishonest when reporting their math and reading scores. With this information, 9th grader scores from Thomas High School were set to NaN, or no value, and the analysis was repeated with the new information.   

### Results
The 9th grade math and reading scores were removed because they were abnormally low. Below you will find a list of each of the seven school district metrics and how each was affected by the changes in the data.
  * The district summary was affected by bringing the total number of students down, but bringing all of scores and percent scores up. 
  * The school summary only changed for Thomas High School. Updated student numbers and scores were added to the summary. 
  * The top 5 performing schools changed by bumping Thomas High School up to being among the top 5
  * The bottom 5 performing schools did not really change. Thomas High School was not in the bottom 5 before, so this list did not change.
  * The average math score for each grade level from each school only changed for Thomas High School; it is higher.
  * The average reading score from each grade level from each school only changed for Thomas High School; it is higher.
  * The scores by school spending per student by school size and by school type changed for the spending range of "$631 - 645", Charter schools, and for medium sized schools, as Thomas High school falls in these categories. The average scores would have increased due to the corrected data. 
### Summary
In conclusion, after the reading and math scores were replaced with more accurate data, the district analysis shows 4 changes of importance. 
  1) Thomas High School became one of the Top 5 Performing schools
  2) Reading scores improved slightly
  3) Math scores improved slightly
  4) Overall scores improved slightly
